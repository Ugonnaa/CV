  <p>I am currently studying a master’s degree in Computer Science and completing an AWS/restart training with Tech Talent Academy in preparation of obtaining the Cloud Practitioner Certificate as I am seeking a career in DevOps Engineering or as a
    Cloud Solutions Architect.
    I have been able to successfully combine my studies with work and other commitments which shows I am organised, motivated and able to work under pressure. I am also very comfortable working in a team. I am looking to utilise my current skills and
    learn new ones.</p>
